# **Amazon A to Z Shift Finder**

## **Overview**

This Python script automates the proceess of finding shifts on the Amazon A to Z portal. It acts as a smart assistant that constantly monitors the schedule based on your personal preferences—such as specific days of the week, shift times, and shift lengths—and attempts to claim them the moment they become available.

**Key Features:**

* **Auto-Login:** Automatically handles the login process after the initial setup.  
* **Smart Filtering:** Only claims shifts that match your exact criteria (e.g., "Only Tuesday mornings under 5 hours").  
* **Persistent Session:** Uses a dedicated Chrome profile to save your cookies, meaning you do not have to enter your password or 2FA code every time the script runs.  
* **Human-Like Interaction:** Navigates the schedule slider and buttons in a way that mimics human behavior to maintain safety and stability.
